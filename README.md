# Steganography
Project Title : Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography

Problem Statement:
In today's digital age, safeguarding sensitive information is essential. Conventional encryption techniques can draw undesired attention, complicating covert communication.
This project tackles the necessity for secure and stealthy message transmission by embedding secret messages within images through the use of image steganography.
It guarantees confidentiality by mandating a password for both encoding and decoding, ensuring that only authorized users can access the concealed data.
Moreover, the project features an intuitive GUI that facilitates effortless encryption and decryption, enhancing accessibility and user-friendliness.

Technologies used:
Python – The primary programming language utilized in this project. 
OpenCV – Employed for processing images. 
Tkinter – Serves as the GUI framework for user interface. 
NumPy – Facilitates efficient management of image pixel data. 
PIL (Pillow) – Provides image manipulation capabilities to ensure format compatibility.

Conclusion:
The project effectively utilizes image-based steganography for secure communication.
It offers an intuitive, password-protected method for embedding and extracting messages. 
The system maintains data confidentiality while preserving the original image's appearance.
It has potential for enhancement with advanced encryption algorithms and AI-driven detection resistance.
